### Goodbye!

After 40+ years, my software development career has come to a close as of July 1, 2022. The repositories contained herein should therefore
be considered static. Do with them what you will!

My personal goal in writing software has always been to elucidate practically a strange and wonderful idea of J.G. Bennett's:

````
In our usual modes of thought we assume that being comes before doing or that being is somehow independent of action ... The truth is
just the opposite. We are nothing at all, it is the action that makes us. Our being is an illusion; it is the action that is really
there ... We can hardly bring ourselves to see that there are doings who be things ...
````

If I have written anything of value, all credit must be given to my determination to follow that idea to its limit. That I so often fell short is, of course, solely my responsibiity.
